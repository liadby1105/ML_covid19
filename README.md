COVID-19 has long become a worldwide pandemic; as of November 2021, there are ~258
million positive cases and ~5.15 million confirmed deaths. This pandemic has posed an
economic recession, affecting hundreds of countries.
there was given data of tests and multiple other features of individuals tested in a big city abroad.
the task who requeried is predicting the number of positive and non-positive tests (based on the features of all
tests, columns F-W in the CSV file). 

for the prediction, I train the following models:
• Linear regression
• Polynomial regression
• Ridge regression
• Lasso regression
• Random Forest
• KNeighborsRegressor

*Tune the model’s hyperparameters to come up with the best prediction.
